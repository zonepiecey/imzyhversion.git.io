                <h1>Leading Design at PwC</h1>
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p class="p">PwC Talent Exchange isn’t just a job board—it’s a mission-critical marketplace where
                    businesses and top independent professionals come together to execute high-value consulting
                    projects. Every month, over $40 million in engagements move through the platform, supporting a
                    complex web of users: engagement managers overseeing contracts, finance teams managing budgets and
                    payments, and independent professionals navigating onboarding and compliance.</p>

                <p class="p">With so many stakeholders, the tasks they handle range from sourcing talent and approving
                    budgets to managing payment cycles and tracking project timelines. Some responsibilities overlap,
                    while others are unique to each role, creating cross-functional dependencies that ripple across
                    multiple systems. On the backend, Talent Exchange integrates with a maze of enterprise tools—systems
                    for budgeting, payments, compliance, legal, and talent management—each with its own logic and
                    constraints. The complexity was staggering, and for engagement managers, navigating this landscape
                    was anything but intuitive.</p>
                <h2>Leading UX at Talent Exchange</h2>
                <p class="p">When I joined, UX wasn’t just about designing screens—it was about designing the way design
                    itself functioned within the organization. As the Product Design Lead, I took on more than just
                    feature work. I built the design discipline from the ground up—hiring designers, structuring
                    workflows, and defining how we prioritized UX enhancements in a way that balanced user needs with
                    business goals.</p>
                <p class="p">To bring order to the chaos, I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built and led a UX team, hiring designers and embedding design within cross-functional squads.
                    </li>
                    <li>Established a UX backlog, ensuring that research insights translated into prioritized product
                        improvements.</li>
                    <li>Created scalable design processes, standardizing file management, design documentation, and
                        handoff practices.</li>
                    <li>Integrated continuous user research, establishing a rhythm for gathering insights and validating
                        designs.</li>
                    <li>Ran stakeholder alignment sessions, bridging the gap between product, engineering, and business
                        teams</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Leadership: I led the design team, collaborated with stakeholders (Product, Engineering, and
                        Business), and made high-level decisions on design strategy.</li>
                    <li>UX Strategy: I defined the overall design vision, prioritized features, and worked closely with
                        the engineering team to ensure feasibility.</li>
                    <li>Collaboration: Worked with product managers, business stakeholders, and engineers to align user
                        needs with business objectives.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>A Growing Problem</h2>
                <p class="p">PwC’s Talent Exchange started as a promising experiment—a marketplace for top-tier
                    independent professionals to connect with enterprise projects. It worked beautifully when the volume
                    was manageable.

                <p class="p">But as thousands of roles, contractors, and engagements flooded in, the once-efficient
                    Engagement Manager Dashboard struggled to keep up.</p>
                <p class="p">Engagement Managers, who once had a clear view of their projects, now faced a wall of data.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They spent hours digging for critical updates.</li>
                    <li>Approvals got delayed.</li>
                    <li>Expiring engagements slipped through the cracks.</li>
                    <li>Onboarding bottlenecks turned into serious operational risks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="p">It was clear: What worked yesterday no longer worked today.</p>

                <h2>Stepping In</h2>
                <p class="p">As the Lead product Designer, I took on the challenge of redesigning the dashboard to
                    handle the new scale. But this wasn’t just a UI problem—it was a fundamental workflow problem.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engagement Managers needed clarity—a way to cut through the noise and focus on what truly
                        mattered.</li>
                    <li>The business needed efficiency—to reduce manual tracking and ensure engagements flowed
                        seamlessly.</li>
                    <li>Engineers needed a scalable solution that wouldn’t buckle under increasing data loads.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Finding the Signal in the Noise</h2>
                <p class="p">We knew that the best way to fix the problem was to listen first, design later. So we went
                    straight to the source: the Engagement Managers themselves.</p>
                <p class="p">I led deep-dive remote interviews with teams across multiple regions. Using Teams screen
                    shares and session recordings, we observed how they navigated the platform in real time, watched
                    their workflows unfold, and mapped out their daily challenges.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>80% of their time was spent on just a few repetitive tasks—approvals, tracking ending
                        engagements, onboarding follow-ups, and role assignments.</li>
                    <li>But these critical tasks weren’t in one place. Instead, managers had to jump between multiple
                        pages, dig through reports, and cross-reference emails just to get through their day.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="p">We needed to go deeper. Observing their pain points was one thing—but we needed them to
                    define their ideal workflow, in their own words.</p>

                <h2>The Workshop</h2>
                <p class="p">To break the problem down, we organized a collaborative online workshop with engagement
                    managers from different teams. Since our participants were spread across multiple regions, we ran
                    the session using Miro and Teams, ensuring that everyone could actively participate, no matter where
                    they were.</p>
                <p class="p">We gave them a simple challenge:</p>
                <p class="p">"List out every task you do in a day. One task per sticky note."</p>
                <p class="p">Participants started individually, adding digital sticky notes to a shared board—everything
                    from approving contracts to following up on onboarding delays. Once we had a comprehensive list, we
                    asked them to sort tasks into categories, grouping similar ones together.</p>
                <p class="p">As managers discussed and debated, clear patterns emerged:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some tasks were quick but frequent, like T&E approvals.</li>
                    <li>Others required cross-team coordination, like publishing roles.</li>
                    <li>A few were high-priority but often buried, like tracking expiring engagements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="p">Despite working in different regions, their pain points were nearly identical. They weren’t
                    struggling with what to do—they were struggling with how to stay on top of it all.</p>
                <p class="p">One manager put it perfectly:</p>
                <p class="p">"I don’t need to see everything—I just need to know what needs my attention right now."</p>
                <p class="p">That was the turning point.</p>
                <img src="imgs/pwc/bucket.PNG" loading="lazy" alt="" class="proimg">
                <h2>The Breakthrough</h2>

                <p class="p">We reimagined the dashboard around a simple principle:</p>

                <p class="p">Urgency and action should drive design.</p>

                <p class="p">Instead of presenting everything equally, we built the interface to function like an
                    air traffic control center—highlighting what was most critical at any given moment.</p>

                <p class="p">At the heart of this were four dynamic widgets, each serving as an immediate
                    "to-do list" for Engagement Managers:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>My Talent Exchange → A high-level snapshot of engaged talent and roles in progress.</li>
                    <li>T&E Approvals → Urgent approvals that need immediate action.</li>
                    <li>Engagements Ending → A countdown of projects nearing completion, color-coded by urgency.</li>
                    <li>Onboarding → A real-time status of new hires—who’s at risk, who’s delayed, and where
                        action is needed.</p>
                </ul>
                <p class="p">Each widget wasn’t just informational—it was actionable. One click took managers exactly
                    where they needed to go.</p>
                    <img src="imgs/pwc/bucket2.PNG" loading="lazy" alt="" class="proimg">

                <h2>Iterative Testing: A Continuous Feedback Loop</h2>

                <p class="p">Designing in a vacuum was never an option. Given the complexity of engagement management,
                    we knew that continuous user testing was key to ensuring the dashboard was not only usable but
                    also genuinely effective.</p>

                <h2>Engagement-Driven Usability Testing</h2>

                <p class="p">At every stage of the design process, we validated our decisions with real Engagement
                    Managers cross different regions. After finalizing the wireframes, we ran lightweight usability
                    tests, walking users through key workflows and capturing immediate feedback. Once we moved into
                    high-fidelity prototypes, we conducted more in-depth testing to refine interactions and optimize
                    information hierarchy.</p>

                <p class="p">But there was a challenge—time zones. With Engagement Managers spread across multiple
                    regions, scheduling tests wasn’t always straightforward. To solve this, we made the process more
                    collaborative. I worked closely with our team to explore different approaches, opening up
                    self-signups for interested participants. The response was overwhelming—far more Engagement Managers
                    signed up than we expected.</p>
                    <img src="imgs/pwc/email.PNG" loading="lazy" alt="" class="proimg">
                    <img src="imgs/pwc/usabilitysession.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="proimg">
                <h2>Building a Community Around User Testing</h2>

                <p class="p">Instead of turning people away, we saw this as an opportunity. We created a User Test
                    Community List, where participants could take turns joining different rounds of testing across various
                    design phases. This gave us a diverse pool of testers while ensuring no single group was
                    overburdened. It also had an unexpected benefit—it fostered a sense of ownership among Engagement
                    Managers, making them feel like active contributors to the product’s evolution.</p>

                <h2>A/B Testing for Optimization</h2>
                <p class="p">Beyond usability testing, we also experimented with A/B testing to refine the dashboard’s
                    effectiveness. We tested different widget placements, information hierarchy, and action-driven
                    layouts to see what resonated best. The insights from these tests directly informed our final
                    design, helping us prioritize clarity, efficiency, and engagement.</p>
                <p class="p">By the time we rolled out the final dashboard, we weren’t just launching a new feature—we
                    were delivering a tool that had been shaped, tested, and validated by the very people who would
                    use it daily.</p>

                <h2>Bringing the Team Along</h2>
                <p class="p">Big redesigns don’t happen in isolation. They require alignment—across product,
                    engineering, business leadership, and of course, the users.
                    I ran bi-weekly stakeholder reviews, ensuring every decision was grounded in both user needs and
                    business goals.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product teams wanted to increase efficiency metrics—so we designed with time-on-task reduction
                        in mind.</li>
                    <li>Engineers needed performance optimizations—so we refined data queries to keep the dashboard
                        lightning-fast.</li>
                    <li>Business leaders wanted better engagement visibility—so we introduced drill-down views that
                        allowed for deeper exploration.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="p">When pushback came—like concerns over too much change, too fast—I worked closely with
                    leadership to phase the rollout, launching in waves and incorporating early user feedback.</p>
